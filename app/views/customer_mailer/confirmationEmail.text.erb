Dear <%= @customer.title %> <%= @customer.firstName %> <%= @customer.surname %>

Thankyou for booking your holiday with us from the <%= @booking.startDate %> on <%= @boat.boatName %> for a week.

The provisional booking will hold the boat for 10 days. All we require you to do is confirm your booking by completing our booking form and returning it to us, this has been sent to you as e-mail attachment. Due to insurance purposes we cannot continue with your booking until the booking form is received.

If you decide that you no longer require the boat please let us know as soon as possible.

Thank you again and we look forward to seeing you.
 
Yours sincerely

Daniel Burnley
